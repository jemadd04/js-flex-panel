# js-flex-panel
Day 5 of JavaScript 30 Challenge - working with CSS flex panels with JS

In this project I worked with the CSS flex property and vanilla JS. When you click on one of the panels it expands with the toggleOpen function and automatically animates the text to enter the panel using the CSS property transform.
